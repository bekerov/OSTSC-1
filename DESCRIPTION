Description: Oversampling of imbalanced univariate time series classification
    data using integrated ESPO and ADASYN methods. ESPO is used to generate a large percentage of the synthetic minority samples from univariate labeled time series under the modeling assumption that the predictors are Gaussian. EPSO estimates the covariance structure of the minority-class samples and applies a spectral filer to reduce noise. ADASYN is a nearest neighbor interpolation approach which is subsequently applied to the EPSO samples. This code is ported from a matlab
    implementation by Cao et al. [2011] and adapted for use with Recurrent Neural
    Networks implemented in 'TensorFlow'.
